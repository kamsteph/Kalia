# Web Pentest Report (2025-07-05T14:51:53.731083)

**Network Scan Report**

**Summary of Detected Open Services and Ports:**

The network scan has identified the following open services and ports on the target system:

* Port 22: SSH (OpenSSH 7.4p1)
* Port 80: HTTP (Apache/2.4.29)
* Port 443: HTTPS (Apache/2.4.29)
* Port 139: NetBIOS (Samba 4.7.6)
* Port 445: SMB (Samba 4.7.6)

**Associated Risks:**

The detected open services and ports pose the following risks:

* Port 22: SSH is open, which allows potential attackers to attempt brute-force login attempts or exploit known vulnerabilities in OpenSSH.
* Port 80 and 443: Open HTTP and HTTPS services may allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in Apache or inject malware through insecure input validation.
* Port 139 and 445: Open NetBIOS and SMB services may allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in Samba or access sensitive data through unauthorized access.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**

To mitigate the identified risks, I recommend the following:

* Port 22:
	+ Implement strong password policies and consider using SSH key-based authentication.
	+ Limit SSH connections to only necessary IP addresses or networks.
	+ Regularly update OpenSSH to ensure the latest security patches are applied.
* Port 80 and 443:
	+ Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent code injection attacks.
	+ Ensure Apache is updated to the latest version, and all security patches are applied.
	+ Consider implementing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and prevent common web attacks.
* Port 139 and 445:
	+ Restrict access to NetBIOS and SMB services to only necessary IP addresses or networks.
	+ Ensure Samba is updated to the latest version, and all security patches are applied.
	+ Consider disabling NetBIOS and SMB services if they are not necessary for business operations.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Conduct regular network scans to detect and respond to new vulnerabilities.
* Implement a robust patch management strategy to ensure all systems and services are up-to-date.
* Consider implementing Network Access Control (NAC) and Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) to enhance network security.

Please note that this is a general report, and further investigation and analysis may be necessary to provide more specific and detailed recommendations tailored to the organization's specific environment and requirements.
