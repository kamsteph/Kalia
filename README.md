# Kalia

Kalia is a private AI-powered pentesting platform that performs both **vulnerability scanning** and **exploit execution** across multiple targets. It uses generative AI to guide tool selection, execution, and result summarization â€” making penetration testing faster, smarter, and more human-readable.
